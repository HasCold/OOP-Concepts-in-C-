    C++ --> initially callled C with classes by Stroustroup
class --> extension of structures (in C);
Structures had limitations{
    --> members are public;
    --> No methods;
} 

 Classes = structures + more;
 classes -->can have methods and properties;
 classes -->can make few members as private and few as public;
structures in C++ are typedef

You can declare objects along with the class declaration;
class Employee{
    class definition
}; hasan,ali,lovish;
 Hasan.salary = 8; makes no sense if salary is private; */
